		<p>My uncle lives in georgia, that is the only reson that we go down there. We normally meet up at his house very early and eat breakfast, then we go out and do our planned activity. My favorite day was the second day we planned out. We walked around Tybee Island all day and went into all the different shops and had a lot of fun at the beach. There are a lot of activitys you can do at georgia, and there are a lot of good places to eat.<p>
